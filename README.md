# BeyondHardware
Short independent research work that aims to answer the question "With the recent development of powerful CPUs, is it still necessary to write highly efficient code?"
Main contents:
- Practical demonstration of how code efficiency has a big impact on computation time.
- Explanation of how code efficiency affects task execution and system reliability.
- Analysis of how Moore's law is slowly dying and its implications for the growing importance of code efficiency as hardware improvements can no longer compensate for increasingly slow software.
